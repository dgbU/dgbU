- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, 
-   This is the creator of Digibyte Unlimited here to say that this is just the begining. 

-   Here in this repository we will be developing the ecosystem of ideas, starting with a decentralized white board. This white board will allow anyone in the world to contribute to this website.

- ðŸŒ± How will it work?
        Digibyte Unlimited will change the current centralized model used throughout most of the world. Here we developers will automaticlly be rewarded for contributing to the website, WITH??? You guessed it, Digibyte!!!
        
-    How does a developer get rewarded by contribution? This is the beauty of the blockchain. In this model we are deploying the ecosystem where develepors build, content creaters provide and promote contant, and consumers get the contant they want by trading there Digibytes for that contant. 

-    In this model developers will get rewarded by the system. The more you contribute to developement of Digibyte Unlimited, the more you make. Developer portian of the reward come from content creators who use your dedicated code to make there contain available. 

-    Also in this model, contain creators must contribute 100 DGB to the pot in order to access the contributer dashboard or platform where they can add their content, this will deter bot abusing the system. This is not all it will do, it will also inhance the content as people will have sense of lose if they don't use their DGB wisely.

-    As so consumers will provide content creators with DGB in order to motivate content creators in providing quality content. The more veiw, clicks the more they make.

-     How will content creators be rewarded with DGB?
          Here we go to a model were people trade DGB for the content they would like to consume.
          
-     It will be up to the content creator to disclose whether they will allow the consumer life time access that that spacific content or for 1,2,3,4,5 time use or for a month or so. In this model though we incurage contain creators to provide ease of access to the content, by let's say low trades for the content in question. Like only one, page of content, or access to the content for 1 day. 

-     Help us build the white board. Here is where people will find new content creators.
